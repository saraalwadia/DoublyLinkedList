# Doubly Linked List in Java

This is a **Doubly Linked List implementation from scratch using pure Java**.  
It is a console-based project designed to demonstrate the functionality of a doubly linked list and how to manage nodes manually.

## Features
- Implements a doubly linked list with `Node` objects
- Supports main operations:
  - **addFirst(Node e)** – Add a node at the beginning
  - **addLast(Node e)** – Add a node at the end
  - **addAfter(int valBefore, Node e)** – Add a node after a given value
  - **removeFirst()** – Remove the first node
  - **removeLast()** – Remove the last node
  - **removeVal(int val)** – Remove a node with a specific value
  - **search(int val)** – Search for a node with a specific value
  - **printList()** – Print the full list
- Educational project to understand **doubly linked lists** and node management

## Installation
